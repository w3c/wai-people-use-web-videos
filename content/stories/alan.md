| Hello! I’m Ade. I’m quadriplegic, which means I have limited movement in my arms as well as in my legs. | A man in a wheelchair speaks directly to the camera. |
| The technology I use is really important to me. I use a lot of keyboard shortcuts, especially for the programs that I use often. For example, scrolling a page is much easier with the arrow keys on the keyboard than by clicking on that button in the scroll bar. | The man is sitting at a desk using a laptop. He uses the arrow keys to scroll up and down a web page. |
| Unfortunately, many websites and apps don’t work well with my keyboard. Often what has focus isn’t clear or jumps around completely out of order. | The man uses the Tab key to complete sections of a form. |
| Sometimes that doesn’t work well because some websites and apps don’t work in landscape orientation, which is how I setup my tablet so that the buttons are big enough for me to click. | The man is sitting and using his tablet in landscape orientation. The web page he is trying to view does not rotate to a landscape orientation. |
| While I can use a keyboard and joystick, I can’t use them for long periods because it’s tiring. So, I recently started using speech control software as well. It allows me to dictate text instead of typing, and to say certain commands instead of clicking. It’s really hard to learn a new way of working after so many years, but I’ve been patient with it and I’m slowly getting used to it. The most difficult thing is buttons without labels – it’s not clear which voice command would activate them. | The man is sitting at a desk. He is talking to his laptop to write an email. |
| You can help make technology accessible to me. Accessibility: It’s about people. | The man speaks directly to the camera. |
