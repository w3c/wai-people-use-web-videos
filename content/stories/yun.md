| Hello! I’m Elias. I’m a retired architect. Life moves slower now that I’m retired, and I think my body does too! | A man speaks directly to the camera. |
| I see less and hear less than in my younger days. Also, my hands shake a little. My children live far away, so we see each other online instead. We also write to each other and send pictures. It’s so much easier and quicker than going to the post office every time. | The man is sitting at his desk using a laptop. He is participating in an online video call with one other person using a video conferencing app. |
| My trouble is all this small text! Why do they write so small? I know how to make the text size bigger but it doesn’t work with all websites. Sometimes everything seems to break down – the text overlaps or goes somewhere else or disappears completely. Or, I have to scroll sideways to read – I don’t have the time and energy for that. | The man is sitting at his desk using a laptop. He is trying to use a website which does not have responsive design. |
| It’s the same with apps. I made the text bigger on my mobile phone. I can’t see without doing that on such a small screen. Most apps work well but not the banking app. The text on that app is still small, and I need to use it to log into my bank account. I already called them several times about this but nothing happens. | The man is sitting at his desk using a zoomed-in messaging app on a mobile phone. He then changes to using a banking app. |
|It’s not only reading, though. When the text is small, all the buttons and links are also small. Sometimes tiny. Especially on forms where you have to click and select all these things – it’s hard with my hands, they don’t behave like they used to. | The man is sitting at his desk using a laptop. He tries to make a selection from a list, but the text is very small. |
| Our grocery store now has an online shop, which is fantastic because I don’t have to carry all the shopping any more. The text is big and it has big links and buttons. It just seems clearer and easier to find things – everything is where it should be on every page. Usually, I have trouble remembering things, like the telephone number, address, and credit card details. This store remembers from before, so I only need to select the right address in the text field rather than needing to type it each time. I wish all websites could be that easy. | The man is sitting at his desk using a laptop. He is successfully using the website of his online grocery store. |
| You can help make technology accessible to me. Accessibility: It’s about people. | The man speaks directly to the camera. |
