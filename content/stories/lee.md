## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Lexie, online shopper who cannot distinguish between certain colors (color blindness). | [Front plate.] box with the text "Lexie, online shopper who cannot distinguish between certain colors (color blindness)." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:10 | [Lexie:] Hello! I'm Lexie. I was born with deuteranopia and protanopia, which people often call "color blindness". | We see Lexie speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Lexie with no visible disability. |
| 2 | 0:10 - 0:33 | I have difficulty distinguishing between red, green, orange, and brown, all of which appear to me as kind of murky brown. In a store, I often can't tell the color of two shoes or two shirts beside each other. I love online shopping because it's often easier for me when they use the names of the colors in addition to showing the colors. | [New scene.] We see Lexie in a casual environment (e.g. at home or at a cafe etc.) using a computer. We see the computer screen with a colorful website using red, green, orange, and brown as they are mentioned. We realize that Lexie is shoping clothes, selecting colors of a product (e.g. shirt, shoe, etc.) with the names of the colors changing as he selects them  [we intentionally will not turn all colors to brown or such]. |
| 3 | 0:33 - 1:03 | Unfortunately, not all online shops have an accessible checkout experience for me. Often the sign-up or checkout form says "fields in red are required". Ugh! Most times I can't tell which fields are required when they use color only. Good shops either have the word "required" or that little asterisk beside the fields, or even better put the word "optional" besides the ones I can skip. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Lexie continuing to the check-out area; he's a new customer to this website and is asked to register. The registration form has many fields (e.g. street name, number, post code, state, region, country, ...), some of which are in red. We see the note "Fields in red are manadatory", and we see Lexie focusing on the screen more closely. |
| 4 | 1:03 - 1:31 | Not relying on color alone is important for other websites and apps too! For example, my favorite fantasy football app has a symbol for each team on the jersey of the players, in addition to color. This helps me spot the players on my team more quickly, not just by reading the names under each player. Unfortunately, my friends are not so keen on this app yet and I have some more convincing to do. | [New scene.] We see Lexie in a casual enviroment (same or different setting, depending on filming logistics), who is now playing a fantasy football game. We see the players of the two teams have differently colored jerseys with different symbols as well. Lexie is very engaged in the game (e.g. biting her tongue, moving around with the game controller, ...). |
| 5 | 1:31 - 2:03 | Color issues also happen at work. For example, when my colleagues highlight words in a document without using the commenting function. The commenting function outlines the marked text in addition to highlighting it. It's also very important that charts have symbols in addition to colors for the lines and bars, rather than relying on color alone. | [New scene.] We see Lexie in a work enviroment (e.g. home office or office) reading a document with comments indicated (e.g. in the document margin). The corresponding text areas are outlined and highlighted as Lexie selects the comments. We then see Lexie studying a bar chart using different colors for the different bars, in addition to a legend that identifies each bar by label. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Lexie:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Lexie speaking her line directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For more information on how people with disabilities use the web, visit w3.org/WAI | [End plate.] We see the URL from the narration. |
