| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:10 | Hello! I'm Lee. I was born with deuteranopia and protanopia, which people often call "color blindness". I love online shopping because it's often easier for me. | We see Lee speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Lee with no visible disability. |
| 2 | 0:10 - 0:33 | I have difficulty distinguishing among red, green, orange, and brown, all of which appear to me as kind of murky brown. In a store, I often can't tell the color of two shoes or two shirts beside each other. I use an online shop that names the colors in addition to showing them. | [New scene.] We see Lee in a casual environment (e.g. at home or at a cafe etc.) using a computer. We see the computer screen with a colorful website using red, green, orange, and brown as they are mentioned. We realize that Lee is shoping clothes, selecting colors of a product (e.g. shirt, shoe, etc.) with the names of the colors changing as he selects them  [we intentionally will not turn all colors to brown or such]. |
| 3 | 0:33 - 1:03 | Unfortunately, other shops aren't as good. Often the sign-up or checkout form says "fields in red are required". Ugh! Most times I can't tell which fields are required when they use color only. Good shops either have the word "required" or that little asterisk beside the fields, or even better put the word "optional" besides the ones I can skip. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Lee continuing to the check-out area; he's a new customer to this website and is asked to register. The registration form has many fields (e.g. street name, number, post code, state, region, country, ...), some of which are in red. We see the note "Fields in red are manadatory", and we see Lee focusing on the screen more closely. |
| 4 | 1:03 - 1:31 | This applies to other websites and apps too! For example, my favorite fantasy football app has a symbol for each team on the jersy of the players, in addition to color. This helps me spot the players on my team more quickly, not just by reading the names under each player. Unfortunately, my friends are not so sold on this app yet and I have some more convincing to do. | [New scene.] We see Lee in a casual enviroment (same or different setting, depending on filming logistics), who is now playing a fantasy football game. We see the players of the two teams have differently colored jerseys with different symbols as well. Lee is very engaged in the game (e.g. biting his tongue, moving around with the game controller, ...). |
| 5 | 1:31 - 2:03 | Color issues also happen at work. For example, when my colleagues highlight words in a document without using the commenting function. The commenting function outlines the marked text in addition to highlighting it. Another example is when charts don't have symbols in addition to the colors for lines and bars -- I can't identify them from color alone. My team is usually careful about this but sometimes suppliers we work with aren't [sigh]. | [New scene.] We see Lee in a work enviroment (e.g. home office or office) reading a document with comments indicated (e.g. in the document margin). The corresponding text areas are outlined and highlighted as Lee selects the comments. We then see Lee studying a bar chart using different colors for the different bars, in addition to a legend that identifies each bar by label. |
| 6 | 2:03 - 2:10 | All this has one thing in common: your design can include or exclude people. | [New scene.] We see Lee speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
