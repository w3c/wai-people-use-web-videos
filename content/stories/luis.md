## Script

| Seq. | Time | Audio | Visual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Sophie, basketball fan with Down syndrome. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Sophie, Basketball fan with Down syndrome." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Sophie:] Hello! I am Sophie. I have Down Syndrome. I love basketball! I played on my school team, and now I work at the stadium. | We see Sophie speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Sophie. [Viewers might notice aspects of her disability.] |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | At work, we use an app for our team. It has a calendar with all our practices and games. My job is to record the scores and stuff like that. I can also use it to chat with the coach and with the players, and we use it to exchange photos and jokes too [chuckles]. | [New scene.] We see Sophie with a tablet at a basketball court (e.g. with others playing the background or just on her own, depending on filming logistics). We then transition to Sophie using the app (e.g. recording scores and statistices, get a chat message etc.). |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Sometimes, I take longer to read things but this app is really easy to use. The event or name of the player is at the top, so I know where I am in the app. The calendar is also very clear. It shows the name of the month or the number of the week at the top too. Other apps we tried are too confusing -- I could never tell where I am and how to get back. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Sophie using the app but now focus more on the app itself rather than on Sophie and what he is doing. We see Sophie looking at an event, player, and calender as the narration mentions them. [The name of the event, player, month, etc. is clear and placed prominently at the top of the page/view; the app looks neat and tidy, and Sophie looks enjoyed using it.] |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | The biggest problem is buying tickets for games. I try to use this app for buying but sometimes I have to use other apps to get tickets. Some of these apps are too hard. When I click on something it goes somerewhere else or opens another page. Or, it doesn't have that blue box at the top and I don't know where I am or how to get back. Sometimes, if I take too long, I have to start all over again. It's a real pain. I wish buying tickets can be easier. | [New scene.] We see Sophie using a ticketing app. It looks more crammed and he is looking more focused while using the app. We see Sophie find a game and select "buy ticket", which takes him to a very differently looking form asking for billing and shipping details for the credit card purchase. Sophie is looking more frustrated. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | My dream is to become a senior assistant. I know I can do it. Soemtimes it is hard for me to write long things but I use the spell-checker every time. I also use a dictionary to find words that I don't know, and it takes me longer to read text with difficult words. It helps me when coaches use words I already know, and most do. One day I'll make it! | [New scene.] We see Sophie sorting books in a library. We then transition to see Sophie sitting in front of a computer at work. We see Sophie reading more slowly and with some difficulty, and we see that he has an online dictionary open beside the text he is reading to lookup difficult words. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Sophie:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Sophie speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | For more information on how people with disabilities use the web, visit w3.org/WAI | [End plate.] We see the URL from the narration. |
