| Hello! My name’s D-H-R-U-V, Dhruv. I’m Deaf. I can hear some sounds but not enough to understand speech. I use British Sign Language – I think and dream in signs. | A man speaks and signs directly to the camera. |
| I recently enrolled in an online degree. For my classes, I schedule interpreters who can interpret the lectures and conversations and voice for me. I need video conferencing apps with functionality to “pin” videos of the interpreters so that I can always see them. | The man is sitting at a desk using a laptop. He is participating in an online meeting using a video conferencing app. He alternates between multiple participant and pinned participant view. |
| Some lectures have real-time captioning typed by human captioners. This is more accurate than automatic captions, which often don’t recognize specialized terms in the lectures. For our assigned videos, I rely on good captions. These are edited so that each sentence appearing on the screen is not too long and is synchronized with the audio. I also often find myself needing to adjust the text size and colors of the captions, to be able to read them better. Some apps also allow me to move the captions to the top or bottom of the video, so that they are not in the way. | The man is watching a video in a media player and selecting English captions from a list of language options. He then selects options for how he wants the captions to be displayed. |
| In some situations, I find myself lip reading. For example, when I’m on unplanned calls without interpreters or other people who can sign. I learned lip reading over the years because of such situations but it’s not always reliable for me. I need to see the person’s mouth, have them speak clearly, and seeing their gestures also helps. Yet it’s exhausting and not really something I can keep doing for too long. | The man is sitting at a desk using a laptop. He is participating in an online meeting using a video conferencing app. |
| I also use the chat function. Some chat tools support real-time text rather than line-by-line text messages only. This is much more interactive. I can engage with my friends in text conversations as others do by voice. | The man is sitting at a desk using a laptop to talk to other people using a chat function. |
| Of course, the classes also come with a lot of reading. I’m fine with that, except when the writing is unnecessarily complex and without structures like lists and headings. People don’t realize that for me reading text involves extra effort, because sign language is my native language. So, like for everyone else, clear and simple writing makes text easier to understand. | The man is sitting at a desk using a laptop and reading through a long, complex text. |
| You can help make technology accessible to me. Accessibility: It’s about people. | The man speaks directly to the camera. |
